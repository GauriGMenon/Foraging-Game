# Foraging-Game
## Introduction:
In order to study the effects of these stimuli on decision-making, we use the foraging task paradigm. The foraging task is one where the explore-exploit tendencies of an individual are made use of in order to make decisions. To test our hypothesis, we are using a virtual patch foraging task for human subjects and conducting a self-assessment surveys to analyze their mood and stress levels.
## How to play:
- Begin with the trial experiment. It contains the necessary instructions to play the game, a video demonstration of the same, and a trial game for practice. Your objective is to collect maximum berries by either choosing to stay at the same bush or move ahead.
- Click the "Start Experiment" button to run the original experiment
You will be redirected to the original game. The game is divided into 2 sessions, in each session the travel time, speed, distance between each bush, and the number of berries changes. Please accurately mark the valence arousal scales in the process.
- Click on the "Move to next game" button get redirected to the game with the incorporation of music. First listen to the music attentively and mark the valence arousal scales carefully. Now continue by playing the 2 sessions of the game, each time with different parameters, but the common aim of collecting most berries.
- You're done! Thank you for your contribution.
>*Note:* The trial game is in the file "[berry_collection_game_trial.html](https://github.com/GauriGMenon/Foraging-Game/blob/main/berry_collection_game_trial.html "berry_collection_game_trial.html")" and this file has to be run first for the study.
